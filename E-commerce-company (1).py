# From the above plots, we can conclude following:-
# - Warehouse block F have has more values than all other Warehouse blocks.
# - In mode of shipment columns we can clearly see that ship delivers the most of products to the customers.
# - Most of the customers calls 3 or 4 times to the customer care centers.
# - Customer Ratings does not have much variation.
# - Most of the customers have 3 prior purchases.
# - We can say that mopst of the products are of low Importance.
# - Gender Column doesn't have much variance.
# - More products doesn't reach on time than products reached on time.
